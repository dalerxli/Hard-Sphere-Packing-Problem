This project is about finding the packing fraction of spheres when their centres are bounded by a cell and collisions occur with the cell boundaries and other spheres.

The spheres are growing in size with respect to time.

The entire system has a periodic boundary.

Currently it doesn't run very fast and I want figure out why.
